The app is a simple and practical project designed to explore Next.js and Prisma. It allows users to search for events in two cities, displaying them from a Prisma database. Each event links to a detail page for more information. Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, the app provides a responsive, user-friendly experience, making it an excellent starting point for learning modern web development tools like Next.js and Prisma.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
